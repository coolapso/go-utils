I am lazy and I don't want to write and to the same things over and over again. 

This repo is just a dumping place for stuff that I use a lot across projects, If I notice I am repeating the same code too often then I'll dump it here and start using it from here. 

Feel free to use use anything from here, import into your code, copy, fork, whatever suits your needs

> [!WARNING]  
> Even tho this repo is for my own use, I will try my best to not break anything around here!
> I follow semver, so please be sure to use pinned versions and pay attention to the release notes
